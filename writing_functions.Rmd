```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

I want a function to compute z-scores

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}
## the input is x

z_scores(x_vec)
```

Try my function on some other things.  These should give errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("my name is jeff")
## doesn't work for a character vector
z_scores(mtcars)
## can't take a mean for a dataset
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
## actually returns a response - but probably not what you want
```

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
## conditional
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}
## the input is x

z_scores(x_vec)
```

These should give erros

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("my name is jeff")
## now it tells you input must be numeric
z_scores(mtcars)
## now it tells you input must be numeric
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
## now it tells you input must be numeric
```

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
## conditional
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("Input must have at least three numbers")
  }
## added another condition - I want things to break if vector is less than 3 numbers
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}
## the input is x

z_scores(x_vec)
```

These should give errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("my name is jeff")
z_scores(mtcars)
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

## now everything is working the way we want it to
```
